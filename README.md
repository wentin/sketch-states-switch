# Sketch States Switch

A tool to save and switch states for quick demo purpose, **Sketch 3.0.2+ support**. 

>Save different states of your sketch files (the visibility of layers and layergroups) and switch between those >saved states when you demo it in a meeting or something. 
>Another use case would be comparing two approaches, jump back and forth quickly to see which one works for the >eyeS.
